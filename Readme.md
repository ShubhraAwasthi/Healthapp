# Cura: Medical services by state and Triage chatbot

A Web Application for finding hospitals and medical colleges in your state equipped with a Triage Chatbot which can help in deciding the urgency of medical care you may need on the basis of your symptoms.

## Need and motivation behind this project:

With the advent of COVID-19, most of the healthcare systems in the world have been experiencing an unprecedented load.Even though hospitals are striving to give the necessary care to their patients, in many cases it is just not feasible.This rush in the hospitals along with the fear of exposure to the virus leads to a reluctance for seeking the required medical help.\
This leads to people becoming their own doctors by researching symptoms.They may end up underestimating their symptoms, or overestimating them- both of which are harmful.\
What is needed is to make decisions taking into account all symptoms-large as well as small and quickly deciding the next course of action.This function is performed to a fairly accurate level by the triage bot.It can help prevent unnecessary visits, and thus also reduce the cost of care.\
The user can also then find nearby hospitals and medical colleges using the webapp which provides information like the admission capacity, number of hospital beds and ownership of the hospital(public/private) which enables them to make an informed decision.
