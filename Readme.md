## Need and motivation behind this project:

With the advent of COVID-19, most of the healthcare systems in the world have been experiencing an unprecedented load.Even though hospitals are striving to give the necessary care to patients, in many cases it is just not feasible.This rush in the hospitals along with the fear of exposure to the virus leads to reluctance in peoples' mind for seeking the required medical help.\
This results in people becoming their own doctors by researching symptoms.They may end up underestimating their symptoms, or overestimating them-both of which are harmful.\
What is needed is to make decisions taking into account all symptoms-large as well as small and quickly deciding the next course of action.This function is performed by the triage bot.It can help prevent unnecessary visits, and thus also reduce the cost of care.\
The user can also then find nearby hospitals and medical colleges using the webapp which provides information like admission capacity, number of hospital beds and ownership of the hospital(public/private). This further enables the user to make an informed decision.

## Tools and Technologies used:

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, JavaScript, Azure Healthbot and Azure static app(for deployment).
